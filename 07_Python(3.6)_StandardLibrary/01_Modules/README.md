# Python 3.6 Standard Library Directory of Modules

This directory contains modules included with most Python distributions. This directory is not an exhaustive list of all modules, but rather a collection of modules I think might be useful and plan to implement in my programs. For a full list of modules included with the Python Standard Library, visit the [Python Module Index](https://docs.python.org/3.6/py-modindex.html), or the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html) for a general overview.
