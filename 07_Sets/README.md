# Sets Repository

*** "sets" in this context is used to refer to the language specific implementation of mathematical sets ***

The projects in this repository are not from any specific articles, videos, or tutorials on the web, but rather from things I think of that can be made faster by using sets. The aim of this repository is to house a number of different programs written in different languages that perform tasks using sets.
