# [Python Django Web Framework - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4)

This project was created following the directions from the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp.org.

## Steps to Create Project:
### Setup:
* Follow steps on codingforentrepreneurs [page](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/install-python-django-on-windows/) up to number 5.
* Then, instead of using virtualenv, use python 3's builtin venv module
  * `python -m venv env`
  * To check to see if the step completed successfully, run
  
  `source env/bin/activate`
  
  `source Scripts/bin/activate` (Windows)
  * To exit environment, use `conda deactivate` or `deactivate`
* Use [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for a reference on virtual environments.
