# Fun-Projects

<p align="center"><img src ="Media/penguin-sideways-stare.jpg" /></p>

I started reading articles that walk through how to make different things and decided to make one entirely self-contained repo that housed all the projects I've come across that I tried doing. The source for each project will always be at the top of the page with a url link to the page where I found it. I'll also include the basics of how to run the project in the README within each folder, but if that isn't descriptive enough, just check out the link to the article at the bottom under the <strong>Source</strong> heading.

If you're still stuck, Google! StackOverflow is a great resource with many relevant questions, and other tutorial sites often contain a wealth of information. If you're not getting what you want to work to work, keep digging around, there's probably a way. If it's taking too long though, it may be worthwhile to just take a step back and check if your environment is setup properly.

Happy coding!
