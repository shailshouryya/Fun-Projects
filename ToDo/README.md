### Data storage concepts
* ACID
* Star schema
* Snowflake schema
* data reliability 
* distributed systems
* pipeline:
  * Ingestion — gathering the necessary data
  * Processing — processing the data to get the end results
  * Storage — storing the end results for fast retrieval
  * Access — enable a tool or user to access the end results of pipeline
* architect distributed systems
* create reliable pipelines
* combine data sources
* architect data stores
* collaborate with data science teams to build appropriate solutions for them
* data engineer roles:
  * Generalist
  * Pipeline-centric
  * Database-centric
* [Eventual Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)
* [Serializability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability)
