# Designing Well-Structured REST APIs with Flask-RestPlus

## Source
This project was completed by following the Medium article written by Preslav Rachev titled [Designing Well-Structured REST APIs with Flask-RestPlus: Part 1](https://medium.com/ki-labs-engineering/designing-well-structured-rest-apis-with-flask-restplus-part-1-7e96f2da8850). Looked for a part 2 but it looks like he never got around to publishing part 2, so this is all there is as of now (April 30, 2019).
