# Fun-Projects

<p align="center"><img src ="Media/penguin-sideways-stare.jpg" /></p>

I started reading articles that walk through how to make different things and decided to make one entirely self-contained repo that housed all the projects I've come across that I tried doing. The source for each project will always be at the top of the page with a url link to the page where I found it. I'll also include the basics of how to run the project in the README within each folder, but if that isn't descriptive enough, just check out the link to the article at the bottom under the <strong>Source</strong> heading.

If you're still stuck, Google! StackOverflow is a great resource with many relevant questions, and other tutorial sites often contain a wealth of information. If you're not getting what you want to work to work, keep digging around, there's probably a way. If it's taking too long though, it may be worthwhile to just take a step back and check if your environment is setup properly.

Happy coding!

We will use a real-world rare event dataset from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10717).

### Programming:
* [Python Programming Exercises by zhiwehu](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises)

## Interesting Repositories:
* [Google Filament](https://github.com/google/filament) - "Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebGL. It is designed to be as small as possible and as efficient as possible on Android.

  Filament is currently used in the Sceneform library both at runtime on Android devices and as the renderer inside the Android Studio plugin."
* [gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) - "The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. Using Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it with the online demo! This project has been forked from Gogs since 2016.11 but changed a lot."
* [TimeSeries_Seq2Seq](https://github.com/JEddy92/TimeSeries_Seq2Seq) - "This repo aims to be a useful collection of notebooks/code for understanding and implementing seq2seq neural networks for time series forecasting. Networks are constructed with keras/tensorflow."
* [mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) - "Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Follow friends and discover new ones. Publish anything you want: links, pictures, text, video. All servers of Mastodon are interoperable as a federated network, i.e. users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one. This includes non-Mastodon software that also implements ActivityPub!"
* [Apache Thrift GitHub Page](https://github.com/apache/thrift) - "Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack with an associated code generation mechanism for point-to-point RPC. Thrift provides clean abstractions for data transport, data serialization, and application level processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition language as input and generates code across programming languages that uses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers."
* [disentaglement_lib](https://github.com/google-research/disentanglement_lib) - "disentanglement_lib is an open-source library for research on learning disentangled representation. It supports a variety of different models, metrics and data sets:

    Models: BetaVAE, FactorVAE, BetaTCVAE, DIP-VAE
    Metrics: BetaVAE score, FactorVAE score, Mutual Information Gap, SAP score, DCI, MCE
    Data sets: dSprites, Color/Noisy/Scream-dSprites, SmallNORB, Cars3D, and Shapes3D
    It also includes 10'800 pretrained disentanglement models (see below for details).

    disentanglement_lib was created by Olivier Bachem and Francesco Locatello at Google Brain Zurich for the large-scale empirical study"
* [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn) - "eo-learn makes extraction of valuable information from satellite imagery easy.

  The availability of open Earth observation (EO) data through the Copernicus and Landsat programs represents an unprecedented resource for many EO applications, ranging from ocean and land use and land cover monitoring, disaster control, emergency services and humanitarian relief. Given the large amount of high spatial resolution data at high revisit frequency, techniques able to automatically extract complex patterns in such spatio-temporal data are needed."
