# Python 3.6 Standard Library Directory

This directory contains components included with most Python distributions. This directory will not be a comprehensive collection of *all* components, but rather a collection of components I found useful or interesting and might want to include in my programs for added functionality.

Check out (https://docs.python.org/3.6/py-modindex.html), or the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html) for a general overview.
